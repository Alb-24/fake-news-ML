# Fake News recognition using ML

Based on Kaggle fake and real news Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset

The basic steps done are:

-read the two datasets of true and fake news and save them as a combined one, adding the target label

-split the dataset into test and train

-apply text preprocessing

-create 3 possible feature representations: tokenizer, vectorizer, tf-idf

-define classifiers: SGD, RF, BLSTM, Logistic Regression

-create 10 splits, training and testing all classifiers

-compare results obtained as classification reports and confusion matrices

# POSSIBLE FURTHER ENHANCEMENTS
-Better text preprocessing

-Better tuning of Hyperparameters
