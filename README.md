Based on Kaggle fake and real news Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset

The basic steps done by the fake_news_py.torch are

-read the two datasets and save them as a combined one, adding the target label

-split the dataset into test and train

-save the test and train datasets (tricky passage, may be possible to simplify it)

# TO DO LIST
-Perform dataframe tokenization

-Generate data batch

-Load the data

-Train the model (possible different ones)

-View model(s) performance and compare them
