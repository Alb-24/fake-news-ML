# fake-news-ML

Based on Kaggle fake and real news Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset

The basic steps done by the fake_news_py.torch are

-read the two datasets and save them as a combined one, adding the target label

-split the dataset into test and train

-perform dataframe tokenization, creating a vocabulary

-generate data batch, using dataloader, to feed the model

# TO DO LIST
-Better text preprocessing

-Train the model (possible different ones)

-View model(s) performance and compare them
